polymake_flint_wrapper
======================

An extension providing a wrapper for the flint library (flintlib.org) in polymake (polymake.org)

This extension depends on the flint library. We wrap Hermite normal form and the LLL algorithm. Currently, those functions are only contained in the flint version on github, but not in any released version of flint. Thus, to use this extension you have to obtain a recent snapshot of flint from github.
